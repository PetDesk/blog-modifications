# blog-modifications

These files are for making simple blog modifications once you've added a blog.

Once you've added a blog to your property you'll need to:
 - remove the RSS feed link in the sidebar
 - Update the stylesheet

## Remove the RSS feed link
In order to remove the RSS feed link in the sidebar navigate to Editor -> HTML Views -> blog-sidebar. Delete the contents of the file and replace them with the contents that are in the blog-sidebar file in this repo.

## Update the stylesheet
In order to update the stylesheet, navigate to Editor -> Style Sheets -> recipe-blog.less. Delete the contents of the file and replace them with the contents of the recipe-blog.less file in this repo.

These steps will complete the necessary modifications to the blog.
